   - Enhanced mouse event handling with multiple fallback mechanisms
   - Tooltips now properly disappear when mouse leaves chart area

5. **Debug System Implementation**
   - Added configurable debug verbosity levels (0-4)
   - Can be controlled via URL parameter (?debug=3) or localStorage
   - Helps troubleshoot chart and data calculation issues

## üßπ Cleanup Performed

### Files Removed
- Temporary log files (*.log)
- CHART_FIXES_VERIFICATION.md (temporary documentation)
- CHART_IMPROVEMENTS.md (temporary documentation)

### Documentation Updated
- CLAUDE.md - Added latest changes, debug system documentation
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Updated status, test scenarios, recent changes
- README.md - Updated features list with enhanced UI capabilities
- Created HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md (this file)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Changes Made

### Key Files Modified
- `frontend/src/app/components/rebalancing-results/rebalancing-results.component.ts`
  - Fixed height calculation (percentage ‚Üí pixel-based)
  - Enhanced current value calculation for excluded coins
  - Added debug verbosity system
  - Improved tooltip event handling

- `frontend/src/app/components/portfolio-entry/portfolio-entry.component.ts`

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Basic Functionality Test
```
Portfolio: BTC: 0.5, ETH: 7, Cash: $800
Expected: Working charts with proportional bars
```

### Excluded Coin Test
```
Portfolio: BTC: 0.1, ETH: 2, ADA: 1000, Cash: $500
Excluded: BTC, USDT, USDC
Expected: BTC shows correct USD value in left chart, excluded from right chart
```

### Debug Mode Test
